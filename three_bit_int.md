# eeshvardasikcm three bit integer theory interfaced with eeshvardasikcm Kepler UI

already I have created a three bit
integer theory that represents
a similar concept to three pointed
attention that people may have heard of.

I practice sankhya yoga and
previously meditated on the amount of
concentration and types of concentration
that it felt like my mind was
required to do for different types of
ways to touch a touch screen device.

this Kepler UI interface is intended to
be a way that an app can moderate
the users input according to the
Kepler algorithm that is used to
moderate the use of energy in
sustainability practices.

I first was envisioning this Kepler
probe technology to be usable in
my mech Commerce game.
in order to use the touch screen
to navigate over 2 dozen thrusters
on one of the mechs, The game player
would have to possibly use all 10
fingers and an extreme amount of
hand eye coordinated dexterity.

you may be aware of the fact that
these sorts of activities for long 
areas of time may cause damage to
the body.

I have already planned to add
assistive technologies to
help control the mechs.

this is another type of assistive
technology in this application.

I was looking for a C++ repository
to contribute to that had some
connection with sustainability.

after some search, the Kepler
repository appeared like a great
technology that I wouldn't mind
working on for use in my
portfolio.

after some short of time thinking
about it, I realized that the
uses that I would have for Kepler
would not be desirable by
any of the technologies
originators.

this Kepler UI that I am planning
on creating, can be used with any
touch screen app to help
reduce the stresses of
repetitive and long-term
use of touch screen devices,
especially where the software on those
devices require a large amount of
touch interaction.
